Library and examples for the Display-o-tron Raspberry Pi add-on board from Pimoroni

Available from Pimoroni: http://shop.pimoroni.com/products/displayotron-3000


##Using python?

We've created a super-easy installation script that will install all pre-requisites and get your Dot3k up and running in a jiffy, just type this into a terminal or LXTerminal:

```bash
curl get.pimoroni.com/dot3k | bash
```

If you choose to download examples you'll find them in `~/Pimoroni/dot3k`, but you can also check out the Basic and Advanced examples in: [python/examples](python/examples)

We've also created a full [function reference](python/REFERENCE.md).
